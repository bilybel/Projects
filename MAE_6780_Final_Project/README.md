README for Final Project

For a formal writeup that explains the entire project in detail, please refer to "Mitchell_Dominguez_Final_Report.pdf". This report includes the derivation of the control law, definition of the state, explanation of how the code works, and an analysis of the controller performance

To run the quadrotor simulation, open MATLAB and run the file "runMain.m". Within "runMain.m", there are comments explaining how to run the code, as well as how to modify the code to simulate various initial conditions, quadrotor constants, and control parameters. 

To view the Simulink model that is at the heart of the project, please refer to "Quadrotor_model.slx".
