# Projects

This repository contains code for the projects that I am most proud of. Following are descriptions of the different directories within this repository...

MAE_4730_Final_Project: The final project for my Intermediate Dynamics class at Cornell that involved deriving the equations of motion for a three-link pendulum and a four-bar linkage and simulating the systems in MATLAB. As an extra feature, I also wrote code to derive the equations of motion and animate an N-link pendulum using the Lagrange method. Included in this directory are the final report that I wrote for this project as well as all of the accompanying simulation and animation code.
