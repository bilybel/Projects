# Projects

This repository contains some of the engineering projects that I am most proud of. Following are descriptions of the different directories within this repository...

MAE_4730_Final_Project: The final project for my Intermediate Dynamics class at Cornell that involved deriving the equations of motion for a three-link pendulum and a four-bar linkage and simulating the systems in MATLAB. As an extra feature, I also wrote code to derive the equations of motion and animate an N-link pendulum using the Lagrange method. Included in this directory are the final report that I wrote for this project as well as all of the accompanying simulation and animation code. 

MAE_6780_Final_Project: The final project for my Multivariable Control Theory class at Cornell was to design a controller that would stabilize the flight of a quadrotor under any set of initial conditions, including if it was thrown upside down. An integral sliding mode controller was developed to accomplish this task and simulated in MATLAB and Simulink.
